# Rewrite Inspector

A terminal UI for inspecting steps taken by a rewriting process.
Useful for the optimization phase of a compiler,
or even evaluators of small languages.

To use the library, the user's type of language expressions
must be an instance of the `Diff` typeclass (see `examples/` for examples).
